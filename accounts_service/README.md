### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

This service is designed to be run using Docker Compose as part of the larger **Relibank** application stack.

1.  **Ensure Docker Compose is Installed**: Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed and running on your system.

2.  **Navigate to the Root Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the `relibank` repository, where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

3.  **Start the Stack**: Run the following command to build the service images and start all containers. The `--build` flag is crucial for applying any code or dependency changes.

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    This command will start the `accounts-db` and other dependent containers, wait for them to become healthy, and then start the `accounts-service`.
